# mern-todo-app
Recruiters, Senior Devs, and other visitors, this project is for you ❤️

## If you want to run things locally
I totally get if you don't, which is why I will try to serve this at some point, but here are the steps anyways. Assume starting path is project root. 

### Client
npm start

### Database (MongoDb)
cd src/backend
mkdir db/
mkdir db/data
mongod --dbpath ./db/data

### Server 
node src/backend/server.js

## Notable Features
It works, hopefully. Notable stuff is coming.
